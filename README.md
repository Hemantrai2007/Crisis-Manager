# Crisis-Manager
Focus on real-world crises like pandemics, natural disasters, or emergencies where resources (hospital beds, food, shelters, etc.) need to be efficiently allocated. The goal is to manage resources effectively using real-time data and intelligent systems.

Here we are creating a web-based crisis management dashboard. Here's how we can break down the solution:

Data Collection System Instead of trying to handle real-time data from actual hospitals (which would be too complex), we created a simplified system where:

Hospitals can manually input their current capacity, available beds, and essential supplies Emergency response teams can update their status and location Supply centers can update their inventory of crucial items

Resource Management Dashboard Create a central dashboard showing:

Hospital occupancy rates using simple visualizations Available emergency response teams Supply inventory levels Basic analytics of the situation
